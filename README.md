# cl-svg
Produce Scalable Vector Graphics files with Common Lisp


This is a basic library for producing SVG files. It makes
simple things easy (well, easier), but makes no attempt
to offer the full freedom of SVG, for which you'd be better
off using an XML library.

You can download this library with Quicklisp.

See `docs/API.md` for how to use this library.

The file `testing.lisp` has a collection of not very well
documented examples.

Unit tests are located in the `test/` directory and
can by run with `(asdf:test-system :cl-svg)`.
